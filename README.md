# Life Studio

A basic personal productivity dashboard. That's it.

## What is this?

Like everyone else, I wanted to build my own to-do list / habit tracker / life organization app. It started as a way to learn modern web development and turned into something functional enough to actually use.

It's not special. It doesn't have AI, gamification, or any revolutionary features. It's just a straightforward dashboard for managing:
- Projects and tasks
- Habit tracking
- Focus sessions (Pomodoro + Deep Work)
- Reading list
- Time budgeting

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 + React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Firebase Auth

Built because I wanted to try the App Router, Server Components, and see how well Supabase + Firebase work together.

## Running locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need your own Supabase and Firebase credentials in `.env.local`.
